        Sometimes, there comes a time in our lives when that seemingly average
        day brings about a memory that gets hold of us and doesn’t let go. One
        day, our chimney needed cleansing from all the coal dust, and the brave
        young boy that I was, I decided it was time that I took this task on my
        shoulders. I climbed up on the roof of our house and let down a brick
        tied to a rope to unclog the chimney tube; this was until the rope
        accidentally slipped from my hands and fell at the bottom of the chimney
        with the brick it was tied to. I returned home and saw the living room
        drenched in soot alongside my family. Father started to laugh and so did
        everyone else, we laughed a lot. After what happened, my father referred
        to me as “Trubachist Programmer” (tube cleaning programmer). Since then,
        I truly, truly became a programmer.
